TODO:

- Query the database rather than just connect

- Proxy for the app?

- Setup containers to do db testing and other testing

- Host the app somewhere
  - options: Google, AWS

- Write logic for sending queries to the db
  - think of use cases:
    - upcoming reminders, new reminders, past reminders, all reminders on a certain day etc
    - might need to change the schema of the db to account for 1 more char in the number

  - list, list <date>, options, create <description> <date>, set reminder interval, set reminder off
    delete <id>, reschedule <id> <date>, etc

- Best way to split the string to easily parse?

- Write the container class that is used for testing 


-----------
IN PROGRESS:
-----------

- Make the parse class generic

- write unit tests for parsing twilio xml
  - make the test.xml in the same directory as the file, just looks more clean: DONE
  - will need to find a way to have multiple files for each aspect and how to make it
    so each request is transformed into a valid query

----
DONE:
----
- Get the database connection working

- Get twilio to freaking approve my campaign
